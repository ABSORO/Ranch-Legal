                <ul>
                    <li>HUT = Hold Until Trial, meaning that a Judge shall sentence or give a trial depending on the individual's plea.</li>
                    <li>If a trial is required, open an LFM ticket.</li>
                    <li>When Judges are in town, a person may plead to all charges listed, and the Judge will handle all sentencing or fine assignment related to any case.</li>
                    <li>Judges may deviate from sentences listed here but MUST respect the drive for story and must never impose capital punishment (CK) or life sentences without explicit Admin approval or consent from the opposing players.</li>
                    <li>Lawmen should feel comfortable charging criminals with the listed times and fines but are also encouraged to lower them if circumstances call for it. Use your judgment to foster good storytelling so that both sides enjoy the encounters.</li>
                    <li>If caught blatantly committing a crime, not guilty verdicts will not be entertained.</li>
                    <li>Starting at 401 Days, sentences can transition to Years (OOC Days). 401 Days = 1 Year, 501 Days = 2 Years, 601 Days = 3 Years... (1 OOC Day = 1440 Minutes). However, if a time is already in years, this does not apply (i.e., 1 Year = 1440 Days â‰  10 Years).</li>
                    <li>Persons may plead Not Guilty to 1st Degree Felonies or higher as well as any individual charges with a stated time of 1 Year or more. All other charges can be appealed after the fact or handled by a Judge on the scene.</li>
                </ul>
