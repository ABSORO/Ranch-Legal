## Sentencing Guidelines

- **Understanding Sentencing Time Calculations:**
  - At 401 Days, sentences transition to Years (OOC Days).
  - **Conversion:**
    - 401 Days = 1 Year (1 OOC Day = 1440 minutes)
    - 501 Days = 2 Years
    - 601 Days = 3 Years
  - **Example Calculations:**
    - [Provide your examples here.]

## Additional Notes

- **Plea Options:**
  - Persons may plead Not Guilty to 2nd Degree Felonies or higher as well as any individual charges with a stated time of 1 Year or higher.
  - Anything else shall be appealed after the fact or handled by a Judge on scene.

[Include any other procedures or guidelines.]
